# Blackjack

This is a simple command-line Blackjack game written in Python.

## How To Play

Run the game by executing the Python script.  
You will be prompted to enter 'yes' if you want to play a game or 'no' to exit.  
The game will deal two initial cards to you and the computer.  
You can choose to take another card or end your turn.  
If you get a hand value of 21 (Blackjack), you win the round.  
If your hand value goes over 21, you lose, and the computer wins.  
If you choose to stop picking cards, the computer takes its turn until it reaches a hand value of 17 or higher.  
The game determines the winner based on the final hand values. You can play multiple rounds.
